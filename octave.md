### Octave Language Learning

Personally, it is more like MATLAB SCRIPT. Andrew Ng thinks that using Python for ML is clunkier for its dependency os each ML library.<br>

* The basic operation about mathmetic operation is similar with MATLAB. To get that syntax details, I can refer to the `help` command.
* `load` command help to load the data from a file.
* [Install Octave on Mac with brew](http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_MacOS_X#Simple_Installation_Instructions_3)
* The `if` syntax needs the endif for octave script.
